## A Tree in an Array
To store a Binary Tree in an Array, we just need to determine the order  that we store the Nodes in. A good order is "breadth-first" where we  store the items in order top-down and left-to-right of the tree.
### Examples

```ruby
puts sqrt(25)
# => 5

puts sqrt(7056)
# => 84
```

#### Get stuck and need some hint?
We can use recursion to search sorted arrays with Binary Search.
