## Challenge
The method sqrt takes in one square number. 

Fill the method sqrt_recursive that returns the square root of a given number.
Do not use any built in methods for calculating the square-root and don't try searching through all the numbers. Instead, use a binary-style search to home in on the actual square root. 
(To make it simpler, the input will just contain square numbers.)

### Examples

```ruby
puts sqrt(25)
# => 5

puts sqrt(7056)
# => 84
```

#### Get stuck and need some hint?
We can use recursion to search sorted arrays with Binary Search.
